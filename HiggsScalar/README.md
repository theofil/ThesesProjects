# Beyond the standard model scalars 

The project is on new scalar particles and their relations to the Higgs boson, in particular through processes at hadron colliders. In practice, one would learn how to install/run Monte Carlo event generators, which generate simulations of LHC or other collider events, and perform a phenomenological analysis of Monte Carlo events to obtain constraints on the Higgs-scalar interactions. A possible outcome of this would be to propose an analysis for the LHC or the Future Circular Collider that would be sensitive to the new scalar-Higgs boson interactions.

The project is offered with co-supervision from Andreas Papaefstathiou, reference paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00597">JHEP05(2021)099</a>
