# Machine Learning 4 Physics
Tools developed by Facebook and Google for physics ? 

We investigate the computational capabilities (GPUs, cloud) of tools developed for artificial intelligence research, 
in physics problems that have nothing to do with artificial intelligence. 

Students may come with their own ideas and develop them further in undegrad/master thesis project.
